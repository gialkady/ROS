## Idea (Problem Description)

How many times you saw a food image on the internet and you feel that you want to eat it NOW ðŸ¤© ðŸ˜‰  

In this project, we tried to make your dreams come true. The idea is a web service that helps people to know the best restaurant to serve the food dish on an image on their city. 

- Firstly, the user upload the food image url.
- ML engine based on deep learning will classify the image (food class). 
- According to the class of food, the system will response with the name of the best restaurant to serve the dish in the user's city.
